# vim-qfable

Qfable is a vim plugin intended to make the quickfix list more useful.

Navigating large, complicated software projects often involves tracing a path
of execution across several function bodies or control flow structures.  On its
face, the quickfix list seems like it could be a useful navigational tool
during long code safaris of this kind.  However, vim doesn't make it easy to
add items to the quickfix list from its UI.  This plugin is intended to address
that.
